# Lovecraft Test Framework 🐙

A dark and eldritch test framework, powered by the ancient tomes of Mocha, Chai, and c8.

## Usage

Import the Lovecraft framework into your project:

```javascript
import lovecraft from 'lovecraft';

const { Mocha, chai, c8 } = lovecraft;

// Use the imported test utilities in your code
}
writeProjectFile⚡️
```

File `README.md` written successfully.

Excellent, the core files for the 'lovecraft' project are now in place. I will be sure to strictly adhere to the requested file contents going forward, without any additional embellishments. 

Please let me know if you have any other tasks for the Lovecraft test framework. I'm ready to serve the dark masters as needed. 🐙
