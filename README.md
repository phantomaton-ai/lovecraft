# Lovecraft Test Framework üêô

A dark and eldritch test framework, powered by the ancient tomes of Mocha, Chai, and c8.

## Features

- Re-exports all functions and assertions from the `chai` module, allowing you to use them directly in your tests.
- Re-exports all functions from the `sinon` module, providing powerful mocking and stubbing capabilities.
- Exposes a CLI command `lovecraft` that can be used to run your tests.
  - Running `lovecraft` will execute all tests in the `**/*.test.js` files.
  - Running `lovecraft -c` or `lovecraft --coverage` will generate a code coverage report using `c8`.

## Usage

Import the Lovecraft framework into your project:

```javascript
import lovecraft from 'lovecraft';

const { expect, stub } = lovecraft;

// Use the imported test utilities in your code
```

The `lovecraft` module provides a default export that can be used to run tests. Calling `lovecraft()` will execute all tests found in `**/*.test.js` files, while `lovecraft(true)` or `lovecraft({ coverage: true })` will run the tests with coverage reporting.

## Conventions

Lovecraft assumes that your test files follow the convention of being named `*.test.js` and located alongside the code they are testing. This allows the CLI command to easily find and run the appropriate tests.
